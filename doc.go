Ivy is an interpreter for an APL-like language. It is a plaything and a work in
progress.

Unlike APL, the input is ASCII and the results are exact. It uses exact rational
arithmetic so it can handle arbitrary precision but does not implement any
irrational calculations. Values to be input may be integers (3, -1), rationals
(1/3, -45/67) or floating point values (1e3, -1.5 (representing 1000 and -3/2)).

Only a subset of APL's functionality is implemented, but the intention is to
have most numerical operations supported eventually. To achieve this, some form of
high-precision floating-point arithmetic may appear.

The APL operators, adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_syntax_and_symbols,
and their correpondence are listed here. The correspondence is incomplete and inexact.

Unary functions.
